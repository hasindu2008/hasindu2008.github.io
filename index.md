My research focus is on the design, development and optimisation of bioinformatics software and hardware for real-time nanopore sequencing data analysis; and, prototyping novel domain-specific computer systems for efficient genomics data analysis. I have more than ten years of experience in embedded computing systems, computer architecture, general-purpose computing with the use of a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), high-performance computing and low-level system programming, that I leverage for the architecture-aware design of efficient computational systems for bioinformatics. I am currently a [lecturer at School of Computer Science and Engineering, UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/hasindu-gamaarachchi). 
I am also a [Visiting Scientist in the Genomic Technologies Group at Garvan Institute of Medical Research](https://www.garvan.org.au/people/researchers/hasindu-gamaarachchi).  I completed my PhD at UNSW Sydney in 2020 (thesis topic: [Computer Architecture-Aware Optimisation of DNA Analysis Systems](https://hasindu2008.github.io/docs/phd_thesis.pdf)). I have served as a lecturer at the Department of Computer Engineering and a resource person at NVIDIA research centre at the University of Peradeniya. I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree with first-class honours in Computer Engineering from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka in 2015.
